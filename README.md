# Markov Random Field method
## main entry
- mrfSingle.py

    calculate once with presented measurement nodes
    
    here gives the demo of 23 measurement nodes

    all the boundary nodes are considered as measurement nodes and do not count towards the number of measurement nodes
- mrf.py

    calculate pcc sets with each count of measurement nodes

- stochastic.py

    calculate pcc sets using traditional stochastic method
